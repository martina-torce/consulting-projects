This analysis consists of recommendations for a large company which is experiencing a high turnover rate, specifically they are interested in retaining high-performing employees. The dataset contains employee profiles for the company such as satisfaction level, last evaluation and average monthly hours of work.  
The dataset was obtained on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksonchou/hr-data-for-analytics).
